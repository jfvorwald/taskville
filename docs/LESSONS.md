# Lessons learned

A running log, newest first. Anyone working on Taskville adds an entry when something surprises them: a wrong assumption, a failed approach, a flaky test, a review finding worth remembering, a tool quirk. Milestone retros in [retros/](retros/) summarize and link these.

Rules:

- One entry per lesson. Keep it short and specific enough that someone else would act differently next time.
- Never delete an entry. If a lesson turns out wrong, add a new entry that supersedes it and link back.
- Every entry has an **Action**: a change already made (link it), a ticket (link it), or "none, awareness only".

Entry format:

```markdown
### L-<number>: <one-line lesson>
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Milestone:** M<n> · **Ticket:** #<issue> · **Recorded by:** <agent or person>
- **What happened:** <one or two sentences>
- **Lesson:** <what to do differently>
- **Action:** <link to change or ticket, or "none, awareness only">
```

## Entries

### L-1: Check the tool's install root before running workflow commands
- **Date:** 2026-10-30 · **Milestone:** planning · **Ticket:** none · **Recorded by:** Claude (planning session)
- **What happened:** Spec Kit had been initialized one directory below the Git root, so its scripts treated `taskville/taskville` as the project root while the architecture placed code at the Git root.
- **Lesson:** Before running a tool's workflow commands, confirm where the tool was initialized and that it matches where the code will live.
- **Action:** `.specify/`, `.claude/skills/` and `specs/` were moved to the Git root on 2026-10-30.

### L-2: Run an independent review before calling a design final
- **Date:** 2026-10-30 · **Milestone:** planning · **Ticket:** none · **Recorded by:** Claude (planning session)
- **What happened:** An independent review of architecture revision 2 found three high-severity gaps: an agent could have approved its own permission prompt with the CLI token, the action card could have hidden part of the input being approved, and needs-you was per project only.
- **Lesson:** Have the security-sensitive parts of a design (anything that grants permission or runs commands) reviewed by someone who did not write them before tickets are cut.
- **Action:** Fixed in ARCHITECTURE.md sections 2.4, 2.8, 9.2 and 13; every milestone that touches auth or commands has a security review ticket.
